<p>Below is my resume template that all tailored resumes start as.
  Each tailored resume highlights aspects of my experience that best fit
  the job application and what the organizatin requires. When finished,
  the resume fits onto one page as not all of my experience is pertinent
  to each position. The resume is available to view online or as a PDF.</p>
