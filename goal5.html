<h1>Goal 5</h1>
<center>Effectively communicate and collaborate to deliver, market, and
  advocate for library and information services.</center>

<h3>Outcome 5B: Apply advocacy principles to demonstrate and promote the
  value of libraries and information agencies.</h3>

Libraries must market and promote their value and the ways they advocate
for their patrons. In this discussion post, I note how the Fountaindale
Public Library applies its advocacy principles for its community. I
highlight their current programs and marketing strategies that directly
match the main tiers of what they want to advocate as a library â€“
"the education, discovery, and enrichment of their community." In this
artifact, I discuss what library-related issues within their community
they are supporting, the kind of advocates they are trying to create, the
market the library is trying to reach, and what they offer to promote
their advocacy principles and values.

<h3>Outcome 5D: Demonstrate effective professional communication to
  achieve common understanding.</h3>

For this outcome, I created an online poster board presentation on public
schools and reluctant readers. I made the poster board for a professional
presentation for other librarians as a part of my 701 coursework. The
information provided on the poster board was to highlight the main points
of my talk, focusing on the background, literature review, the core values
of the school library, and concluding remarks. Through this, the goal was
to achieve a common understanding among school librarian professionals in
alternative practices and methods they can implement in their libraries
and with their teachers to achieve reading success with their reluctant
readers.

<h3>Outcome 5E: Demonstrate leadership principles in an educational,
  professional, or community context.</h3>
<h4><a href="{{'/assets/docs/leadership.pdf' | relative_url}}" target="_blank">Leadership Paper for LIS 707: Leadership, Marketing, and Strategic Communication.</a></h4>

<div class="column">
As a part of my 707 coursework, I chose to focus on the leadership theory
provided by Brene Brown's book Dare To Lead and her work on leadership
and vulnerability. In this paper, I interviewed two children librarians
within the Chicago Public Library system to find out their leadership
style and the leadership environment of their superiors. The leadership
principles found through this paper illustrate how strong leadership from
a vulnerability theory viewpoint does not mean having the title of leader
but how one implements the principles in their professional workspace.
This artifact notes how these leadership principles impact the library
settings of the two interviewees, which in turn play a role in how
patrons and superiors view them in a professional and community context.
