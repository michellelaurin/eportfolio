This artifact analyzes the discussion surrounding the web and the efforts
to revise copyright laws and intellectual properties. Through this post,
I view the debate through a library and information professional lens
and how we, as librarians, teach our patrons about this issue. This
discussion post also focuses on the impact of broadband access patrons
have outside of the library and the library's role in providing it. I
also discuss that librarians and information professionals should be
aware of and knowledgeable of information policies locally and globally.

  communities and organizations.</h3>

For this artifact, I chose the physical discussion post that looks at
two socially and financially diverse populations and assesses their
needs and interests regarding physical access to digital media. Through
this comparison, I articulated their differences and how it impacts the
families, particularly the school-age children, who were trying to
juggle online school with limited digital media access. In the discussion
post, I assess the families' needs and note how these social and
financial differences affect their ability to participate in an
information and technology-driven society.

I created a grant proposal for a K-8th public school in California
based on the needs of the 1st through 3rd-grade classes in providing
headphones for the academic school year of 2020-2021. I chose the need
for headphones for each student due to the COVID-19 pandemic and
students needing personal headphones to ensure their health and safety.
After talking with a school teacher about what the information needs are in her
class, I created the proposal for the upcoming school year. This grant
proposal allowed students to receive headphones and created a program called "We
Listen" to work in tandem with the already existing program I Read that
the teachers utilize.
