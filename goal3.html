<h1>Goal 3</h1>
<center>Navigate, curate and create information across the spectrum of human records.</center>

<h3>Outcome 3A: Design resources or tools that facilitate access to
  information.</h3>

For this artifact, I created a website titled:
<a href="{{'https://michellelaurin.github.io/World-of-Tales/' | relative_url}}" target="_blank">The World Of Folk And
Fairy Tales</a>. The website contains information about folk and fairy tales,
their definitions, and their history. It also has two pages that provide
stories found worldwide and annotated bibliographies on folk and fairy
tale books and collections. These two web pages allow users to read some
tales in their entirety and find their source on Project Gutenberg and
find out what people group and nation these tales originate in the
version provided. On the annotated bibliographies page, I created a list
of book resources people could learn about that are also organized by
location or by the author's last name. This page gives the user access
to information about the book before they pick up the book.

<h3>Outcome 3C: Evaluate resources or tools that facilitate access
  to and manage information.</h3>

I evaluated the book, The Storyteller's Start-Up Book: Finding,
Learning, Performing and Using Folktales by Margaret Read MacDonald.
The evaluation of this resource allows beginning storytellers to decide
whether this is a tool that they would like to learn from and possibly
include in their collection. Through this evaluation, I focus on the
book's contents, its resources, tale choices, and included activities.
The paper focuses on the book's overall usefulness and the author's
authority on the subject of storytelling. This artifact accomplishes
outcome 3C by evaluating a resource that facilitates access to and
manages helpful information to a storyteller.

<h3>Outcome 3D: Assess applicability of current and emergy technologies
  to information management.</h3>
<h4><a href="{{'/assets/docs/textbook.pdf' | relative_url}}" target="_blank">Hands-On Research Paper for LIS 708: Evidence Based Planning, Management, and Decision Making.</a></h4>

This artifact focuses on electronic textbooks increase in the academic
sphere and whether it is a technology that current MLIS students use for
their information management. Through the research, the group analyzed
electronic textbook trends for other academic studies and interviewed
current MLIS students on their textbook choices. This artifact meets
this outcome by looking at the surrounding factors of the current
technologies and emerging ones that provide electronic textbooks for
students. It focuses on how students create and manage their collection
of books that offer resources and information for their studies. The
research found that although e-textbooks were applicable in some ways,
there was still a need for both current and emerging technology to be
fully accessible for all users.
