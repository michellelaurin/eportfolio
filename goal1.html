As librarians and information professionals, our core values and
ethics have grown and evolved since its inception as a profession.
One example of this is how we catalogue people. This artifact covers
how cataloguers began to label people and have begun to run into
problems with causing more harm than good when labeling as there can be
a loss of nuance or privacy. The discussion post meets the requirements
of this outcome. It focuses on how cataloguers began labeling and
organizing the changes that they have made. The artifact also focuses
on the changes they need to make as librarians and cataloguers begin
to evaluate current practices to the dynamic nature of the core values
and ethics of the library and information professions and the world
they desire to serve.

<h3>Outcome 1B: Articulate the philosophies, theories, models, and/or
  major perspectives of the library and information professions.</h3>
<h4><a href="{{'/assets/docs/frbr.pdf' | relative_url}}">Discussion post on the FRBR conception model for LIS 703: Organization of Knowledge.</a></h4>

In this discussion post, I had to note where FRBR fits into the
"four ideas through modern Anglo-American library history" found in
William Denton's chapter "FRBR and the History of Cataloging." This
artifact focuses on examining the FRBR model and how it fits into the
larger picture of the evolution of theories and models that library and
information professions used to catalogue their resources. Through this
analysis, I followed the inception of cataloguing concepts, various
professional attempts on methods and models, and professionals' primary
perspective and model – the FRBR model.

<h3>Outcome 1D: Apply the core values and ethics of LIS to diverse
  local, national, and gloabal context.</h3>
<h4><a href="{{'/assets/docs/trends.pdf' | relative_url}}">Association Trends Summary Paper for LIS 701: Core Values, Ethics and Issues in Library and Information Profession.</a></h4>

Through COVID-19, the library profession has needed to align its core
values and ethics to practical changes to assist its patrons. This
artifact focuses on the Association for Library Service to Children
(ALSC) and its response to the shift in e-learning in both public and
school libraries. The paper discusses how the ALSC has made changes to
continue applying its core value of being "dedicated to the support and
enhancement of library service to children. From programming and best
practices to continuing education and professional connections…." As
well as analyzing how it implements those core values locally,
nationally, and globally as the pandemic impacted people and
organizations worldwide.
