<h1>Welcome to Michelle Le Laurin's E-Portfolio</h1>
Hello, I am Michelle Le Laurin. I am an MLIS candidate at Dominican University for August 2021. Welcome to my E-Portfolio, where I exhibit fifteen assignments from different courses to represent my time as an MLIS student at Dominican. Through these artifacts, I will demonstrate how I have accomplished the five learning goals and outcomes that every student must achieve through their tenure. The website's organization includes individual pages for each goal, the reflective essay, and my resume. Each artifact is available to view online or as a PDF. At the end of my time at Dominican, I will have finished with a certificate in Youth Services and a certificate in Web Design.</div>

<h1>SOIS Student Learning Goals</h1>
<li><a href="{{'/goal1/' | relative_url}}">Goal 1</a>: Develop a professional identity and philosophy within the library and information professions.</li>
<li><a href="{{'/goal2/' | relative_url}}">Goal 2</a>: Understand the essential nature of information and its relevance to society.</li>
<li><a href="{{'/goal3/' | relative_url}}">Goal 3</a>: Navigate, curate and create information across the spectrum of human records.</li>
<li><a href="{{'/goal4/' | relative_url}}">Goal 4</a>: Synthesize theory and practice within a dynamic and evolving information environment.</li>
<li><a href="{{'/goal5/' | relative_url}}">Goal 5</a>: Effectively communicate and collaborate to deliver, market, and advocate for library and information services.</li>

<h1><a href="{{'/essay/' | relative_url}}">Reflective Essay</a></h1>
Part of the requirements for this e-portfolio is to look back on my time at Dominican University in the MLIS program and reflect. This reflection paper involves considering my classes and course work and informing the reader and myself on how these artifacts represent my overall experience and education. I will also explain how I have grown in my understanding and philosophy as a librarian and how I will take what I have learned and apply it to my career.

<h1><a href="{{'/resume/' | relative_url}}">Resume</a></h1>
For the requirements of this e-portfolio, I have provided my resume template that all tailored resumes start as. When I have sent in my resume as a part of an application process, I have made changes that fit the specific requests found for that job. The resume is available to view online or as a PDF.
