<h1>Goal 4</h1>
<center>Synthesize theory and practice within a dynamic and evolving
  information environment.</center>

<h3>Outcome 4A: Apply library and information science theories,
  principles, and research to professional practice.</h3>

This research paper focuses on the question of "How do I move my student
from a reluctant reader to an enthusiastic reader?" Throughout the
artifact, I look at the current theories, principles, research, and
practices in the library and schools to provide practical methods for
librarians, teachers, and family members in helping their reluctant
readers. I include current methods used in both library and classroom
settings while analyzing the various data on their pros and cons and add
alternative ways one could use instead of or in tandem.

<h3>Outcome 4B: Descrive how library and information science theories
  and practices may inform and improve emerging technologies.</h3>

Library and Information science theories and practices revolve around
the desire to provide information access to their patrons. As such,
libraries have continued to pivot and make changes with the increase
and introduction of technologies. Through this artifact, I focus on how
those theories and practices currently in place can inform and improve
emerging technologies, particularly the library's application of social
media. Social media is a technology that is constantly emerging and
evolving in new ways. As such, I focus on how a public library can
implement the two most popular sites with teens, Instagram and TikTok,
to reach their teen patrons. Through the paper, I argue that the library
already has the theories and practices but can better inform and improve
their use in these technologies and better impact their relationship with
the teen population.

<h3>Outcome 4C: Demonstrate teaching and learning principles in
  relation to professional practice.</h3>

This artifact is a lesson plan that focuses on primary versus secondary
sources taught within a school library to an 8th-grade class. The lesson
includes: the learning outcomes and objects, the Illinois Learning
Standards, and a step-by-step guide on how the teaching portion would
occur in a professional setting. From this artifact, one can see that I
meet the outcome of 4C in demonstrating both teaching and learning
principles in a school library setting. I provide examples in my lesson
plan on expected questions and answers that students will give and ask
throughout the lesson. While also including how I will respond and make
changes to my class based on students' reactions, questions, answers,
and feedback.
